    <h1>Liege Belgian Waffles with Pearl Sugar</h1>
    <img src="../img/waffles.jpeg" width="150px" alt="Image of Waffles" />
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      These are sweeter than traditional Brussels Belgian waffles - a sweeter
      waffle that can be served for breakfast or dessert. Serve waffles warm or
      cooled with whipped cream and berries or drizzled with warm, melted
      chocolate.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul class="ingredients">
      <li>1 (.25 ounce) package active dry yeast</li>
      <li>1 ½ tablespoons white sugar</li>
      <li>¾ cup lukewarm milk</li>
      <li>3 eggs</li>
      <li>1 cup melted butter</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
      <li>3 cups flour</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>1 ½ cups pearl sugar (such as Lars' Own®)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Sprinkle the yeast and white sugar over warm milk in a small bowl. The
        milk should be no more than 100 degrees F (40 degrees C). Let stand for
        15 minutes until the yeast softens and begins to form a creamy foam.
      </li>
      <li>
        Whisk the eggs, melted butter, and vanilla extract into the yeast
        mixture until evenly blended; set aside. Stir together the flour and
        salt in a separate large bowl, and make a well in the center. Pour the
        egg mixture into the well, then stir in the flour mixture until a soft
        dough forms. Cover with a light cloth and let rise in a warm place (80
        to 95 degrees F (27 to 35 degrees C)) until doubled in volume, about 30
        minutes. Gently mix in the pearl sugar.
      </li>
      <li>Preheat a waffle iron according to manufacturer's instructions.</li>
      <li>
        Place a baseball-size ball of dough on the preheated waffle iron. Cook
        waffles until golden and crisp, about 2 minutes. Repeat with remaining
        dough. Allow waffles to cool for 2 to 3 minutes before serving.
      </li>
    </ol>
